"Use the below list of facets ONLY and follow ONLY Query Rules: and examples for syntax  to develop AWS cloudsearch syntax to write a query to search for the most critical finding in the data.  Use markdown and show the search query as a codeblock.Do not capitalize "OR" or "AND" statements.  Show the generated query wrapped with ``` under the heading "Attack Search Intelligence Search query"  Under a sperate heading  titled "Link to Attack Surface Intelligence Results" Include a  url that combines :https://platform.securityscorecard.io/#/asi/search/+generated query but it will contain spaces, so please urlencode the url.

Query Rules:

To filter your results so that they only apply to specific categories of information, use facets. 
The structure of a simple filtered query is:
[facet]: ‘expression’
Enclose literal text and literal expressions in single quotation marks ('). Integer and float (decimal) fields, as noted in the table descriptions for ASI facets, do not require quotation marks.
For facets with multiple expressions use parentheses and an operator, and repeat the pairing for each expression:
(and [facet]: 'expression' [facet]: 'expression' [facet]: 'expression')
(or [facet]: 'expression' [facet]: 'expression' [facet]: 'expression')
(or [facet]: 'expression' [facet]: 'expression' [facet]: 'expression' (and (not [facet]: 'expression')))
Example: (or cloud_provider:'aws' cloud_provider:'oracle' cloud_provider:'gce' cloud_provider:'azure')
Example 0: "(and port:22 threat_actor:'Lazarus Group' industry:'GOVERNMENT')"
Example 1: "(and has_ransomware:1 industry:'FINANCIAL_SERVICES' country:'DE')"
Example 2: "(and crawling_detected_library_name: 'WordPress' (and (or hostname:'dev' hostname:'test' hostname:'qa' hostname:'staging')))"
Example 3: "(and has_infection:1 has_threatactor:1 has_cve:1 has_ransomware:1 has_malrep:1)""
